{"name":"Calamares","tagline":"Distribution-independent installer framework","body":"### Welcome to the Calamares web presence.\r\nThis project started as a desire of several independent Linux Distribution to come together and work on one universal Installer.

For partitioning, parts of the all new KDE frameworks are in use (also Qt 5 based).\r\n\r\n### Video Demo:  \r\n<http://kaosx.us/media/cala_web.webm>\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCode is maintained on github:  \r\n<https://github.com/calamares>  \r\nMailing list:  \r\n<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/calamares-dev>  \r\nIRC:  \r\n<http://webchat.freenode.net/#calamares>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
